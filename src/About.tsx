      Hello, My name is Nuradeen Sheikh. I am a Full Stack Developer.
      I continue to learn about technologies and best practices to demonstrate value.
      I use sites like <strong>Udemy.com</strong> and <strong>Frontendmasters.com</strong> to
      further my knowledge and to clearly understand the tools I'm already familiar with to increase productivity.
      I also enjoy cooking and reading about middle eastern history during my free time.
